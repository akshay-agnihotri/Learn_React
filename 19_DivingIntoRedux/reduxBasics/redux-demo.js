// Redux internally triggers the reducer to initialize the state. Even though no action is dispatched explicitly, this is how Redux works â€” it ensures the store has an initial state by running the reducer once when the store is created.
// The counterReducer is called with the default state { counter: 0 } during initialization.
// The reducer increments the counter by 1 (because it always returns { counter: state.counter + 1 }), so the initial state of the store becomes { counter: 1 }.
